As a drinker,

When I am in a new City, I can enter that city name
When I click the search button, it shows a map of the city you are in
The map will have markers displaying where breweries are located
Under the map, a list of breweries corresponding with the map
When I hit add to favorite button, It will save the selected brewery
When I hit the favorites button, it brings me to a page of all the saved breweries
